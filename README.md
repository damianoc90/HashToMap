# HashToMap
The current view of the big data have been enormously changed because of the management of big quantities of data and an efficient analysis of them is a difficult assignment.
For these reasons our project, using distributed computing techniques such as MapReduce and MPI, allow to analyze social networks contents, searching inside keywords (hashtag) summarizing and highlighting, in a geographic map, places where these keywords are most used.
This tool is oriented to the analysis of social networking content to predict and intuitively understand mobility phenomena, natural disasters, social events, social trends and opinions, thanks to a geographic representation of such contents.
